# Discord-Token-Reset
## Publicly posted discord tokens will be put here so it can be instantly reset and notify the owner.

# You may be asking "how does this work"?
## Discord scans git repos to see if they contain a token on commit and will instantly reset any token it finds.

# NOTE: PLEASE PUT YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKENS IN THE .ENV FILE! THIS IS BAD THAT I FOUND A LOT OF DISCORD BOT TOKENS!
# PUT YOUR TOKEN IN .env AND PUT client.login(process.env.TOKEN) in the bot js file!
